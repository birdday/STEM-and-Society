## Mission Statement
As scientists, we understand that the work we do does not exist in a vacuum, but rather is deeply entangled with the society around us. Thus, we believe it is our mission to discuss openly and freely about the way in which science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) inmpacts society so that the work which we dedicate our lives to not only changes the world, but changes it for the better.

The STEM and Society Lecture Series gives graduate students and early career researchers a platform to do exactly this. We hope that this lecture series brings together graduate students from across our university to share ideas and build community. Please join us for upcoming lectures, and check out past lectures as well. If you have any interest in becoming a speaker, please feel free to reach out!
