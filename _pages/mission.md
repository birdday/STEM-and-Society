## Mission Statement
As scientists, we understand that the work we do does not exist in a vacuum, but rather profoundly impacts the society around us. Fossil fuels were one considered a technological breakthrough, and now we are witnessing the effects of climate change daily. Consider also the COVID-19 crisis (which at the time of writing this we are currently experiencing). Everyday we see the evolution of our understanding of the virus, the constantly updating recommendations by the CDC, and the race to expand testing, improve treatment, and develop a vaccine. Even more so, we see the way that technology such as phones and computers have kept up connected during it all. Clearly the work we do has the capability to transform the world around us - It already has and will continue to do so. Thus, we believe it is our mission to discuss openly and freely about the way in which science, technology, engineering, and mathematics interact with society so that the work which we dedicate our lives to not only changes the world, but changes it for the better.

The STEM and Society Lecture Series gives graduate students and early career researchers a platform to share and learn about how our research is deeply entangled with social issues. We hope that this lecture series brings together graduate students from across our university to share ideas and build community. Please join us for upcoming lectures, and check out past lectures as well. If you have any interest in becoming a speaker, please feel free to reach out!
